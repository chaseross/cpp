# CPP Notes
### May 20, 2016

- Need to add in date when they said they would by assets (sometime between 10/3 EESA and 10/13 equity purchase announcement)
- This is important bc its one of the big points that you really want to avoid; don't say you're going to do something and then suddenly change your mind -- looks like you don't know what's going on, doesn't inspire confidence. This is *exhibit A on what not to do*.
- $125 billion is not included in the $205 billion number. 
- This can be broken down into a few cases:
1. CPP case overview
2. Case on the structure of the CPP, the auction of investments structure et cetera
3. The 125 billion injection 4. Need a case on the UK equivalent


- Am an henceforth capital guy.
